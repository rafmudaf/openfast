      OpenFAST text output is valuable to help explain your problem. Text output copy/pasted here is ideal since it is searchable, but sometimes a screen shot is more clear. Use your judgement. Please do not post a screenshot of text.

      This form uses GitHub's Markdown syntax (see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
      When including text output from OpenFAST or lines of code, they should be wrapped with three ticks (the other symbol on the ~ key in US keyboards), like this:

      ````
      ```
      OpenFAST-v2.0.0
      Compile Info:
      ```
      ````

      To enable syntax highlighting, add the programming language in the first set of ticks:
      ````
      ```fortran
      do i=1,2
        call MyFortranCode()
      end do
      ```
      ````
